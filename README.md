# Tr책dfri-MQTT


## Install

```bash
npm install -g tradfri-mqtt
```

## Usage

To start the service:
```bash
# 192.168.0.99 = Your tr책dfri gateway
# abcdefgh = The pre-shared key printed under the gateway
# tcp://127.0.0.1:1883 = Address to MQTT

tradfri-mqtt -g 192.168.0.99 -p abcdefgh -a tcp://127.0.0.1:1883
```

## Getting updates

tradfri-mqtt will try to observe everything that's being published from the gateway, and mirror the messages into
MQTT with the prefix `tradfri-raw/`. 

For example, if the tr책dfri pushes and update for the lightbulb `65554`, the raw json message will be published 
to the MQTT topic `tradfri-raw/15001/65554`.

Subscribing to `tradfri-raw/#` will give you all messages, `tradfri-raw/15001/#` all accessory 
updates and `tradfri-raw/15004/#` all group updates.

## Sending commands

Commands to the tr책dfri gateway can be sent by publishing them to the MQTT topic `tradfri-cmd`.
The payload should be a json-encoded string matching the definition:

```typescript
export declare type TfCommand = {
    // CoAP Method
    method: "get" | "post" | "put" | "delete",
    // URL without any prefixes, i.e. "15001/65540"
    url: string,
    // Optional id of the request, will be included in the reply
    id?: string,
    // Replies will be sent to this MQTT topic
    replyTopic?: string,
    // Payload of the request (for POST or PUT)
    payload?: object|string,
}
```

If `replyTopic` is set, a reply will be sent to that topic. The definition of the reply:
```typescript
export declare type TfReply = {
    // ID of the request as set in TfCommand
    id?: string,
    // Response code, for example "2.04"
    code: string,
    // Format of the response, 50 = json
    format: number,
    // Payload, if format is json the payload is decoded into an object, 
    // otherwise it will be a raw string 
    payload: string|object,
}
```
